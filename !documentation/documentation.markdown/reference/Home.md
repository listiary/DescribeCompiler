The Describe markup language is parsed and translated to various destination languages. This is done by the Describe Compiler, which is written in C#. The compiler, although easily portable to other languages like C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python3 and few more, has no official ports. This document explores the C# Visual Studio solution, project by project
The Describe Compiler project uses semantic versioning. The Describe compiler is currently in a version 0.9 which is an open beta. 
We have devised (and are devising) describe source code test files (.ds) that aim to test various different scenarios for each version of the Describe grammar.
