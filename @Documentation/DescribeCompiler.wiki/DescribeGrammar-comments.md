Comments in describe are much like comments in C++ or C#, or other C type languages - we have single line comments, that start with two slashes and a space `// ` and end with a new line, and we also have the delimited type, starting with slash and a star - `/*` and ending with a star and a slash - `*/`. 

Note that, unlike comments in C++ or C#, or other C type languages only two slashes `//` without the space afterwards won't produce a comment, and will be treated as regular text. This might seem annoying to some, but is done in order to not have to escape said slashes when writing links it text, which would probably be more annoying.
    
Example:  
![comments](https://github.com/viktorchernev/DescribeCompiler/assets/72315339/1e25fb7b-b285-4717-abcd-657d75c8d7a4)

***
_Note - Nesting of comments is not supported, as in most major programming languages._
