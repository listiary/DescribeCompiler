BUG:One letter bug
If we have a single symbol that is a Text and is parsed as text chunk, then we have some escaped symbol that should be parsed as text chunk as well, we get an error. for example:

t\-shirt

This might be due to some bug in the grammar
Yes, was a simple grammar bug:

Text = {TextCharacter}{TextCharacter}+

should be 

Text = {TextCharacter}+

as '+' is 1 or more, not 0 or more
