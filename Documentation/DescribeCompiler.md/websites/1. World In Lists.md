_I. World In Lists_

"World of lists" aka "World in lists" is a project to create a free-content online collection of lists on various topics and a community of volunteers to write, edit and moderate those lists - it is like Wikipedia, but for lists. The project consists of various sub-projects, pieces of software, scripts and modules, most of which fall under the umbrella of one of three broader categories - the web infrastructure (aka Websites), the "Describe" markup language that is used to write the lists/articles (aka Language), and the lists/articles that users have written (aka DataLists).
