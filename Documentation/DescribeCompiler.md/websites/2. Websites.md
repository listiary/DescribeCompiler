_II. Websites_

1. WorldInLists
[WorldInLists.Net](https://development.worldinlists.net/) is the main website of the project. Here, users can read, edit and create their own lists. The lists are divided in 5 categories - Documentation, Public, Drafts, Personal, Private (read more in chapter IV "THE DATA LISTS"). Only registered users might edit or create lists, as well as enjoy more features and richer experience. WorldInLists is a wiki type web app, written in php and JavaScript. It is a proprietary software at the moment, but will probably be made free and open source some time in the future. The [[database documentation]]

2. Forums
The forums are of great importance for the project - this is the place where all the discussions on various topics take place, where the community meets and greets, ponder on ideas, vote on new features and policies and much more. In Wikipedia, there is a talk page with each article, but in WorldInLists those discussions happen on the forums as well. The forums are hosted in the subdomain [forums.worldinlists.net](https://forums.worldinlists.net/), and are powered by "[phpBB](https://www.phpbb.com/)" - a tried and tested open source software ([GPL v2 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html)). The forums' database dumps will be publicly available on GitHub as well.

3. Documentation
The Documentation website - that is the website that hosts this documentation, and possibly the place you are reading this text from right now. It is a simple static website that contains all the documentation for the entire "World in lists" project. Two major parts of the documentation infrastructure are the user documentation - which teaches users how to use all of the software, and the technical documentation, which provides intimate knowledge on how those software function. A project roadmap goes here, as well as site and directory maps, manifestos, licenses, TOS, and other related documents. The documentation website is hosted in its subdomain, as well as on github as a github page, and the content in the Documentation website is free and open source and registered under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/)

4. AutoListMakers
A directory of various scripts and tools for creation and editing of describe lists is being compiled and will be hosted on GitHub. Some tools are going to be public, while others will probably need to be restricted on a need to use basis. Many of those will be third party tools as well. This directory is not public yet. List maker tools will be shared under different licenses, depending on the authors choice. Tools published as a part of this project are published, and if not exclusively stated otherwise should be considered published under the [AGPL v3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).
