_III. THE DESCRIBE MARKUP_

Similar to Wikipedia's (Wiki markup), there is a markup language that has been developed for the WorldInLists project - the "Describe" markup language. It is a domain specific language that is used to write various lists. It is compiled to different languages, like HTML, XML or JSON (in the case of WorldInLists, the describe compiler is utilized to produce JSON files). However, Describe language and the compilers for it are FOSS (free and open source software) that users can easily utilize in their own projects, if they wish so. The compilers are licensed under the [AGPL v3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html), meaning that everyone can use them for personal and copyleft-ed projects, but a permission is needed for commercial use. The decision weather to grant such permission free of charge or for a fee is done on a case by case basis.

The Describe compiler is built on top of the open source Gold Parser and runs on .Net technology, thus needing the .Net framework, but there are no other dependencies. Users can choose between using the CLI App, referencing the DLL (API) or using the Visual Studio Project (and possibly building on top of it).
