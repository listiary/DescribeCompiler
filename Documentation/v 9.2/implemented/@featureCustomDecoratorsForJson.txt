FEATURE: Custom decorator.

This is a way to add decorators that are not implemented, use the template for a custom decorator, and will be implemented in the front end instead.
{custom|NAME}
{custom|NAME|VALUE}

This feature has been added to the JSON_COMMONER set and the inbuilt JSON translator.
There is a field "decorators" in all the appropriate templates (ones that have links):

	"decorators":[

		"{NAME}":"",
		"{NAME}":"",
		"{NAME}":"",
		...
	]

or

	"decorators":[

		"{NAME}":"{VALUE}",
		"{NAME}":"{VALUE}",
		"{NAME}":"{VALUE}",
		...
	]

Yet to be added to the HTML translator in the future, but how will those decorators be added to the HTML tags? Probably as class names or some kind of attributes?
