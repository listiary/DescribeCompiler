DescribeParser - Transpiler for the Describe Markup Language

This is the actual Compiler. Although I want to open a bracket hear to say that it is actually a Transpiler, rather than a true compiler, as it us a tool that translates a language to another high level language, as opposed to machine instructions, but many people might not be familiar with this terminology, so Compiler it is.
