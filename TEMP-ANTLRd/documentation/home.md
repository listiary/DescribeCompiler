Describe Compiler Documentation

The Describe markup language is parsed and translated to various destination languages. This is done by the Describe Compiler, which is written in C#. 
The compiler, although easily portable to other languages like C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python3 and few more, has no official ports. 
This document explores the C# Visual Studio solution, project by project.
