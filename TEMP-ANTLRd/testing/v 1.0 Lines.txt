This list explains the contents of the basic test files for Describe version 1.0 "Lines".
Describe version 0.9, as well as version 0.6 and 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9 should pass as well, in order to prove backward compatibility. 
These tests are not extensively covering all possible edge cases, but keep in mind that we have a hundreds of files in the Describe library, that will serve as a test as well.
